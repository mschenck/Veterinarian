# Veterinarian

Modular framework for rapidly developing custom monitoring/heartbeat/notifications for services and systems.  Here's how it works...

1. Create [Modules](modules/) appropriate to you critical service(s)
2. Write your [config](/config.yaml)
3. Fire up [Veterinarian](/bin/veterinarian)

```
Usage: veterinarian [options]
      -c, --config [file]              path to config (required)
```
